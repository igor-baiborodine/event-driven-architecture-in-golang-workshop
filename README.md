This is the code repository for [Event-Driven Architecture in Golang](https://www.packtpub.com/product/event-driven-architecture-in-golang/9781803238012?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781803238012), published by Packt.

**Building complex systems with asynchronicity and eventual consistency**

## What is this book about?
Event-Driven Architecture in Golang is an approach used to develop applications that shares state changes asynchronously, internally, and externally using messages. EDA applications are better suited at handling situations that need to scale up quickly and the chances of individual component failures are less likely to bring your system crashing down. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand different event-driven patterns and best practices
* Plan and design your software architecture with ease
* Track changes and updates effectively using event sourcing
* Test and deploy your sample software application with ease
* Monitor and improve the performance of your software architecture

-- execute queries, updates, inserts, deletes ...
PREPARE TRANSACTION 'bfa1c57a-d99d-4d74-87a9-3aaabcc754ee';
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This hands-on book is for intermediate-level software architects, or senior software engineers working with Golang and interested in building asynchronous microservices using event sourcing, CQRS, and DDD. Intermediate-level knowledge of the Go syntax and concurrency features is necessary.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
